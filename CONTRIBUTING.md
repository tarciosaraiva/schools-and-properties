## I want to contribute code but don't know where to start

If you're not sure where to start, look at the [project board](https://github.com/tarciosaraiva/schools-and-properties/projects/1). Otherwise create an issue and label it "feature request" and the owner of the repo will continue the conversation there.

## I'm ready to contribute code

Awesome! We basically follow vanilla NuxtJs installation - just use `yarn lint` and `yarn test` before pushing your code that all validations will happen.

## Pull requests

- Please write tests for any changes
