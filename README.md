## Motivation

While researching for our next place to live I found myself constantly looking up 3 websites:

- A property search website popular in Australia
- [Find My School](https://www.findmyschool.vic.gov.au/) to see which school would be in the catchment zone of the property I was interested in
- [Better Education](https://bettereducation.com.au/) to have an idea of school ranking that I found using the website above

It is annoying and exhausting to constantly swap between these websites so I decided to do something about it. This project is the initial thinking of what I want to do - yes, MVP, for those that like acronyms.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
