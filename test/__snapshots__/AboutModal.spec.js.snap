          <p>The information provided by this website is a collation of 3 major data sources, listed in the attributions modal accessed by the link at the footer of this website.</p>
          <p>We are showing all schools currently listed in the Data Vic. The ones faded do not have any rating associated with them. The ones not faded are the ones that have a score of 90 or above in <a href="https://www.bettereducation.com.au/" target="blank">Better Education</a> website so.</p>
          <p>You will also notice that the not faded schools have different sizes: this is due to your rating filter. If you have a score of e.g. 95 then every school that matches that number or above will have a larger icon than the ones that have a lower ranking.</p>
